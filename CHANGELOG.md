  [#277](https://github.com/OSC/ood-dashboard/issues/277)
- (Batch Connect) Look for sub-app configuration under the global path
  `/etc/ood/config/<app>/` for system iHPC apps or with the appropriate env var
  set. [#293](https://github.com/OSC/ood-dashboard/issues/293)

### Fixed
- Fix Rack app development by using `bundle` instead of `bin/bundle` as well as
  updating lint checks. [#290](https://github.com/OSC/ood-dashboard/issues/290)

## [1.19.0] - 2017-12-15
### Added
- Loads /etc/ood/config/apps/dashboard/env file as dotenv file when in production
  environment. Can change location of this by setting `OOD_APP_CONFIG_ROOT` in
  .env.local. This allows moving app specific environment configuration to
  /etc/, easing installing and updating the dashboard app.
- /etc/ood/config/apps/dashboard/initializers and
  /etc/ood/config/apps/dashboard/views now are optional paths to place custom
  initializer and view and view partial overrides
- App Index page at /apps/index now displays all apps. The shared apps that
  formerly displayed here are now accessed at /apps/featured. The link to /apps/index
  page only appears in the navbar if the env var `SHOW_ALL_APPS_LINK` is set to
  '1'

### Changed
- Changing nav bar brand colors are now a runtime config, not build time config.
  Changes in dotenv files will be applied on application restart. New runtime config
  for branding only works for background, link colors, and navbar type.
  `OOD_BRAND_BG_COLOR` and `OOD_BRAND_LINK_ACTIVE_BG_COLOR` can be used to
  configure the colors of the navbar. `OOD_NAVBAR_TYPE` still can be used.
  `BOOTSTRAP_NAVBAR_DEFAULT_BG` and `BOOTSTRAP_NAVBAR_INVERSE_BG` will be
  treated as if setting `OOD_BRAND_BG_COLOR`. `BOOTSTRAP_NAVBAR_DEFAULT_LINK_ACTIVE_BG` and
  `BOOTSTRAP_NAVBAR_INVERSE_LINK_ACTIVE_BG` will be treated as if setting
  `OOD_BRAND_LINK_ACTIVE_BG_COLOR`.
- Load dotenv files in two passes: .env.local files first, then the rest of the dotenv files.
  This allows overriding `OOD_APP_CONFIG_ROOT` in .env.local which is useful for
  testing configuration changes when doing development.
- Configuration object is now created in config/boot so it can be used in setup
  scripts and rake tasks that don't load the config/application.

### Removed
- Removed the need for .env.development .env.test  and .env.production files by
  using sensible defaults and avoiding setting RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT in the
  dotenv files

## [1.18.1] - 2017-11-22
### Changed
- Updated to latest Rails 4.2.10 for better Ruby 2.4 support.
  [#195](https://github.com/OSC/ood-dashboard/issues/195)
- Updated `ood_support` gem to 0.0.3 for better Ruby 2.4 support.

## [1.18.0] - 2017-10-20
### Added
- Logs the full command line call for any forked processes.
  [#260](https://github.com/OSC/ood-dashboard/issues/260)

### Changed
- (Batch Connect) Check boxes are now placed inside of `form_group`.
  [#266](https://github.com/OSC/ood-dashboard/issues/266)
- Updated `ood_core` library which includes bug fixes and new Batch Connect
  helper functions for scripts.
  [#263](https://github.com/OSC/ood-dashboard/pull/263)
- The developer dashboard is enabled by default if the sandbox directory exists
  for the user. [#264](https://github.com/OSC/ood-dashboard/issues/264)
- Changed app edit button to "Edit Metadata" and moved to right side.
  [#272](https://github.com/OSC/ood-dashboard/issues/272)

### Fixed
- Load a proper login shell for Interactive Apps when using an LSF resource
  manager. [#262](https://github.com/OSC/ood-dashboard/issues/262)
- Fixed the misnomer from "New Product" to "New App".
  [#257](https://github.com/OSC/ood-dashboard/issues/257)
- Fixed the default sorting column on Products list page.
  [#273](https://github.com/OSC/ood-dashboard/issues/273)

## [1.17.0] - 2017-09-27
### Added
- optional dashboard help url "Configure Two Factor Authentication" set using
  `OOD_DASHBOARD_2FA_URL` env var
- new Configuration object to centralize domain specific app configuration

### Changed
- The configuration flag for enabling developer mode is no longer
  `NavConfig.show_develop_dropdown`, it is now
  `Configuration.app_development_enabled` and this defaults to the env var
  OOD_APP_DEVELOPMENT being present; the flag can be modified in the initializer
